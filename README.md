This is my journey with the [Network Programming with Go](https://nostarch.com/networkprogrammingwithgo) book.<br>
My thoughts, insights, and takeaways about the technologies taught in the book and Go in general are in the commit messages.

The repo consists of basically the same code that is presented in the book, but reimplemented by myself in the way I preferred.
Sometimes the difference is tangible, sometimes the code is almost identical.

Most of the code is full of comments. If they seem silly or redundant, well, they are ðŸ§’.
That's because I tried to reproduce the code after commenting it through and through, and then erasing the original version,
simply to gain some muscle memory in Go.

P.S. the book is an absolute find!
